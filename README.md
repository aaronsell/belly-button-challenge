# belly-button-challenge

## Overview

This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dashboard will allow users to visualize the data and gain insights into the microbial species present in different individuals’ belly buttons.

## Technologies Used

	•	Plotly: For creating interactive plots and visualizations.
	•	D3: For manipulating documents based on data.
	•	JavaScript: For adding interactivity and functionality to the dashboard.
	•	HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the dashboard.

## Features

	•	Interactive Charts: Visualize the distribution of microbial species using various chart types (e.g., bar charts, bubble charts).
	•	Dropdown Menu: Select different individuals to update the visualizations dynamically.
	•	Metadata Display: Show additional information about the selected individual, such as demographic data.
